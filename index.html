<a href="./dotfiles/init.el">My emacs init.el file. Nothing much to it, emacs for a lot of things works great for me OOTB.</a>
<p>I like emacs, it's cool. I don't care for the vi vs emacs editor war, both are nice. Right now I really prefer doing any art stuff traditional, if I must do digital at least for animation do it in blender (which is really the one I like the most compared to other animation programs), so that for the time being is what I shall use.</p>
