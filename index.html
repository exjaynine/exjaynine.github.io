<h1>This is my personal website for Matthew Polk.</h1>
<p>You can find here any sketches/drawings/cartoons I make in addition to any creative writing I do such as a screenplay or short story.</p>
<p>I'm generally right now getting more familiar with how to take advantage of krita to the fullest, so you'll right now see my krita repo being more populated than the GIMP one. Plus krita has more functionality like traditional animation capabilities and generally is faster developed.</p>
